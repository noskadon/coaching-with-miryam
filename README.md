A Light at the End of the Tunnel

This project is a complete recreation of a previous website I built for a family member’s business. The current version was built on a WordPress template but the template was quite limiting. Rather than re-work the template’s HTML and CSS it makes sense to start again from scratch. The replacement site should not affect SEO and search engine indexing since it will be posted to the current host so the DNS is not affected.

The requirements for the site from the customer:
    • a calming color palette
    • relaxing imagery including beaches and floral scenes
    • a contact form
    • an alternate means of contacting the business
        ◦ a button that pops up the direct phone number
        ◦ the phone number is hidden with a JavaScript trick to prevent, or at least make it more difficult, to scrape from the site
    • descriptions of the services provided
    • a PayPal.me payment button

The requirements from myself:
    • styling using the Bootstrap framework
    • images serving as buttons in the contact form
        ◦ the buttons would return a ‘checked’ or ‘unchecked’ status
        ◦ the buttons would replace radio buttons or checkboxes
    • a fixed-top menu with an overlapping image that disappears when scrolling down the page

Features that would be nice to have:
    • a translate button so the site is accessible to both speakers of English and Spanish
    • inactive content sections are hidden so that the page has a fade-out/fade-in effect rather than scrolling

To prepare for this project I reviewed several websites in the same industry.
